**Summary of the Project**
For this course, I worked on the DriverPass system, a client project focused on helping students pass their DMV driving tests. The client, Liam (the business owner), and Ian (the IT officer), wanted a web-based system that allowed users to register, schedule driving lessons, take online practice exams, and stay up to date with DMV rule changes. Administrators needed to manage students and instructors, generate reports, and ensure secure access to data. From these requirements, I created two key deliverables: the Business Requirements Document and the System Design Document.

**What I Did Well**
I’m especially proud of how clearly I translated the client’s needs into structured UML diagrams. My class diagram showed the system’s architecture with accurate roles and relationships. My activity and sequence diagrams also clearly illustrated the user workflows, especially the step-by-step process for scheduling a lesson or taking a test. These visual elements supported the documentation and made the system easier to understand for both technical and non-technical team members.

**What I Would Revise**
If I could revise one part of the project, I would expand the interface descriptions or mockups in the system design document. While the backend logic and structure were clear, more detail on the actual user interface would have improved how future developers or testers interpret the user's experience. Including some wireframes or annotated UI sketches could have strengthened the documentation further.

**Interpreting and Implementing User Needs**
I paid close attention to the interview transcript and ensured that every feature Liam and Ian described was reflected in my design. For example, Liam wanted role-based access, customizable training packages, and a cloud-based system with DMV integration. These needs were implemented into the functional requirements, class diagrams, and technical specifications. It’s important to consider user needs during system design because the success of the system depends on how well it solves the real problems users face. Ignoring or misinterpreting these needs can result in wasted effort and costly redesigns.

**Approach and Strategies for the Future**
Going forward, I’ll continue to use a combination of interviews, requirement analysis, and UML modeling to guide system design. I’ve learned the value of starting with user stories and goals before jumping into design. Using tools like Lucidchart for diagramming and version control through GitHub made the process organized and traceable. I’ll also prioritize building out interface design components earlier and ensuring that documentation is clear enough for any developer to follow without confusion.
